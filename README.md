# fitting-room
It is an Android app that lets you see how clothes fit you using AR. My teammate and I developed the Android app from the mockups provided by the designer on our team. I added more advanced features including Google Vision API and camera input processing. I presented the demo. This project led us to semifinals (top 6 out of 50 projects).

It was created for AngelHack Silicon Valley. July 2019
